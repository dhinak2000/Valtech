Selenium Webdriver Automation is used for the purposes of this test. I used the Java  to script the entire test in a single file with assertions for each question. In realtime automation, page object model framework will be implemented for the automation and additional effort would be required to e.g. incorporate the Page Object or Screenplay patterns, and make the tests more atomic and resilient. For the purposes of this exercise, I have covered all the required validations with minimal effort and code.X-Path has been chosen as the element selection mechanism as it is always  recommended and stable.
